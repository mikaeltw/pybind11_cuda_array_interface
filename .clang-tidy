# Checks actively ignored due to the reasons described below.
# -llvm-header-guard: pragma once is not llvm standard or even c++ for that matter.
# -modernize-avoid-c-arrays: std::array is not supported in cuda kernels.
# -modernize-use-trailing-return-type: Forcefully put auto everywhere seems dull.
# -modernize-use-nodiscard: Marking things from only declarations cannot be correct.
# -readability-static-accessed-through-instance: threadIdx.x accesses are fine and very much readable.
# -readability-magic-numbers: Of course they should be reduced, but having to name every single one seems a bit extreme.
